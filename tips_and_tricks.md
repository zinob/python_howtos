# Run all cells above current in Jupyter Lab

It is a tad bit clunky to "run all cells above current" in Jypyter Lab and there is no single shortcut key for it. 
The best way I have found is the following sequence:
* `Esc` (to exit edit-mode)
* `Shift` + `Home` (to select all cells to the top) **or** `Ctrl/Command` + `A` (to select all cells)
* `Ctrl/Command` + `Enter` (to run all selected cells)
